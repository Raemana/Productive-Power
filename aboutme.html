           <p>Productive Power is a potential software which could help
            people spend their screen time productively and effectively.</p>
            <p> • It uses the help of Google to analyse and construct a personal
                program for your screen time so that your eyes don’t get
                damaged.</p>
                <p>• For instance, we all have medical profiles. All you need to do is
                    link it to the software and it will try and find out how much
                    screen time is acceptable for your eyes.</p>
